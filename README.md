# Socio-Economic Indicators Analysis in Developing and Emerging Countries (IBMz Datathon)

## Project Overview

This project focuses on the analysis of datasets from various developing and
emerging countries, such as India and Malawi, to gain insights into their
socio-economic indicators. The primary goal is to identify correlations, trends,
and patterns within these datasets. By examining a wide range of socio-economic
indicators, we aim to provide valuable information for policymakers,
researchers, and anyone interested in understanding the dynamics of these
nations.

## Motivation

The motivation for this project is rooted in the recognition that developing and
emerging countries play increasingly significant roles in the global
socio-economic landscape. These nations are experiencing rapid changes and have
the potential to influence not only regional but also international economic and
political dynamics. Understanding the socio-economic conditions and correlations
within these countries is essential for making informed decisions and creating
targeted policies that can lead to positive change.

## Data Sources

We have collected and analyzed data from a variety of sources, including
international organizations, government agencies, etc.. These datasets contain a
wide array of socio-economic indicators, such as GDP growth, education levels,
healthcare access, poverty rates, and more. The inclusion of diverse data
sources allows us to paint a comprehensive picture of the socio-economic status
of the countries under investigation.

## Analysis Process

Our analysis involves the use of modern data analysis tools and frameworks,
including the powerful LinuxOne platform. With these tools, we have performed
statistical data analyses and data visualization to uncover hidden correlations
and trends within the datasets. This process not only aids in understanding the
current socio-economic landscape but also in making informed predictions for the
future.

## Key Objectives

1. Identify correlations between different socio-economic indicators in
   developing and emerging countries.
2. Provide insights that can inform policy decisions aimed at improving the
   quality of life for citizens.
3. Contribute to the body of knowledge surrounding the socio-economic conditions
   in these nations.
4. Facilitate understanding by sharing our findings with a wider audience.

## How to Use the Project

This project is open-source, and the code and data used for the analysis are
available in the repository. You can explore the codebase and the datasets to
